 28-nt marker
I am having a really hard time finding a commercial ladder for small RNAs. Raya mentions that they “now we use 26nt and 34nt markers; they work better.” Ingolia’s protocol states the following : 
• Upper size marker oligoribonucleotide NI-NI-19, 5′-AUGUACACGGAGUCGAGCUCAACCCGCAACGCGA-(Phos)-3′. The designation (Phos) indicates 3′ phosphorylation (note that all residues are ribonucleotides)

And something similar for the lower size marker. I am guessing that they synthesized their own markers. 

The closest that I have found is http://www.lifetechnologies.com/order/catalog/product/AM7778 which shows 10, 20, 40, 50 .. 100 nucleotides. There is also http://www.biodynamics.co.jp/e/prd_dm250.htm (which I think is a Japanese firm) that has a 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 nt marker. Another one is http://www.zymoresearch.com/rna/rna-markers/zr-small-rna-ladder which has a 17, 21, 25, and 29 nt ladder.
